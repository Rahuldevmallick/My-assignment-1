            <p class="bg-img"> Look, when I was 60, I submitted my resignation. “Why do you want to retire?” the board asked. “Is the work becoming too heavy on you? Do you want to do something else? If you’re enjoying your work and we enjoy you, why don’t you continue?” So I said OK. When I turned 70, I did the same thing. I said, “I think I should go.” They said, “You cannot.” Staff members all over the country were writing me letters saying, “Don’t leave. This will bring a panic.” So again I couldn’t leave. But I wrote a letter by my own hand and took it to the finance minister and said, “I’m trying to retire as CEO, so why doesn’t the government appoint me as chairman? This way I can continue in a nonexecutive position and the position of CEO can go to a new person, without disrupting the whole motion of the bank.” Then last year the [government] authority asked for my resignation, saying I was illegally holding on to the position of CEO; I should have retired 10 years before at the age mandated by government bank rules. I contested in the high court, but the court did not accept my case. So I resigned. </p>

                        Thousands of people have rallied in Bangladesh’s capital to demand the prosecution of ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and those responsible for hundreds of deaths in a mass uprising against her government in July.

The Anti-Discrimination Student Movement organised what it called the March for Unity on Tuesday at the Central Shaheed Minar, a national monument in Dhaka. Protesters chanted slogans calling for Hasina’s trial and the banning of her Awami League party.
